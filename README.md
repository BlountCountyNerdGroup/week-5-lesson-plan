# week-5-lesson-plan

Today's lesson was definitely fun, but at the same time, I feel like they were purely introduced to new concepts, so there was little time to deepen the understanding. So again, good lesson, but if they had more time to experiment, that would be good. 7.5/10

Also note that unlike other weeks, the other repository (week 5 code) is where the full code for this week is.
